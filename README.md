# JS/TS-Datastructs-and-Algos

JS/TS doesn't give me out of the box data structures and uses some sort algorithms based on engine, kinda annoying  
this is really just for me to impliment common data structures/algos in JS for practice  
if this gets extensive, i might look into just making this a library and use it myself  


## Things i plan on implimenting:

1. Singly/Doubly LinkedLists
2. Basic trees, maybe one that auto balances 
3. graphs, probably like 4 of them 
4. Stacks and Queues
5. Elementary sorts
6. merge and quick sort **MAYBE**

## Early in the project, i decided to start rewrite in typescript for fun/practice  

You can see the older ones completed in plain js in JS-data-structures(just single/double linked)
