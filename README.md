# TS-Datastructs-and-Algos

TS doesn't give me out of the box data structures and uses some sort algorithms based on engine, kinda annoying  
this is really just for me to impliment common data structures/algos in TS for practice  
if this gets extensive, i might look into just making this a library and use it myself  


## Things i plan on implimenting:

1. Singly/Doubly LinkedLists
2. Basic trees, maybe one that auto balances 
3. graphs, probably like 4 of them 
4. Stacks and Queues
5. Elementary sorts
6. merge and quick sort **MAYBE**

## There is some unit testing being done with Jest.js in /Tests
