# TS-Datastructs-and-Algos
This is really just for me to impliment common data structures/algos in TS for practice. 
If this gets extensive, i might look into just making this a library and use it myself. 


## Things I plan on implimenting and testing with Jest.js:

1. ~~Singly/Doubly LinkedLists~~
2. ~~Basic trees~~
3. Graphs
4. ~~Stacks and Queues~~
5. Elementary sort functions
6. merge/quick sort functions
7. dfs/bfs

## If for some weird reason you want to clone this and use it
1. be sure to have yarn installed 
2. run 'yarn install' to install dependencies 
3. run 'yarn test' to see the tests in action
